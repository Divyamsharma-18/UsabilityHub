# 🧪 UsabilityHub-Inspired Homepage – Built with HTML, CSS & JS

A clean, modern landing page crafted using pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — designed to mirror the visual polish of professional marketing sites.

This project was a layout & UI practice challenge I gave myself: build a full landing page from scratch with a strong focus on structure, responsiveness, and design principles — no frameworks, no shortcuts.
